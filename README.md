# SFML_snake
This SFML snake is the course project for "Object Oriented Programming",
ans is based on source code from "https://github.com/jhpy1024/sfSnake"

How to play

1.	Run main.exe and follow the instructions to set up your own theme before you start the journey.
	You are allowed to choose different types of background colors and grids in this page.

2.	Use ↑ ↓ ← → to move your snake towards different directions or simply click your mouse
	inside game screen which makes the
	snake turn to that direction.

3.	When your snake successfully eat the fruit on the screen, it may grow;

		Black / Brown fruits 	---- 	grow 0 node
		Green fruits 		---- 	grow 1 node
		Blue fruits		---- 	grow 2 nodes
		Red fruits 		---- 	grow 3 nodes

4.	There are also gems(one at a time) and bombs(two at a time) in the game, you can see them as bonus fruits.
	Every time you eat a normal fruit, those three bonus fruits' position will change so that it would be a bit
	hard to eat them. Each time your snake manage to eat a gem, the snake earns 15 nodes length as bonus! But be
	careful to keep away from the bomb which makes you lose the game immediately.
	
5.	Every time you lose the game, you can see the total score you got on the screen.(We offer you 5 scores originally)
